# AI Papers and News Archive
AI Paper and News Archive from Omar Santos's AI Research Agent.

Let’s be honest... keeping up with the flood of new AI papers and news is impossible these days. With dozens of publications coming out every day, staying current is more than a full-time job. I built a basic AI agent that collects papers and news from multiple sources every day, summarizes them, and posts the highlights in a Webex space. The agent also categorizes everything by topic. If any of the papers or news items are related to “Securing AI” or “Using AI for Security,” it goes a step further… correlating relevant items and providing additional insights.
