Summary: <p>Many AI systems focus on isolated tasks or simple prompt engineering. This approach allowed us to build interesting applications from a single prompt, but we are starting to hit a limit. Simple prompting falls short when we tackle complex AI tasks that require multiple stages or enterprise systems that must factor in information gradually. The [&#8230;]</p>
