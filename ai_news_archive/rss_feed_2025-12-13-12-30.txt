### Title: The Machine Learning “Advent Calendar” Day 12: Logistic Regression in Excel
Link: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-machine-learning-advent-calendar-day-12-logistic-regression-in-excel/
Summary: <p>In this article, we rebuild Logistic Regression step by step directly in Excel.<br />
Starting from a binary dataset, we explore why linear regression struggles as a classifier, how the logistic function fixes these issues, and how log-loss naturally appears from the likelihood.<br />
With a transparent gradient-descent table, you can watch the model learn at each iteration—making the whole process intuitive, visual, and surprisingly satisfying.</p>

### Title: Decentralized Computation: The Hidden Principle Behind Deep Learning
Link: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-power-of-decentralization/
Summary: <p>Most breakthroughs in deep learning — from simple neural networks to large language models — are built upon a principle that is much older than AI itself: decentralization. Instead of relying on a powerful “central planner” coordinating and commanding the behaviors of other components, modern deep-learning-based AI models succeed because many simple units interact locally [&#8230;]</p>

### Title: EDA in Public (Part 1): Cleaning and Exploring Sales Data with Pandas
Link: https://towardsdatascience.com/eda-in-public-part-1-cleaning-exploring-sales-data-with-pandas/
Summary: <p>Hey everyone! Welcome to the start of a major data journey that I’m calling “EDA in Public.” For those who know me, I believe the best way to learn anything is to tackle a real-world problem and share the entire messy process — including mistakes, victories, and everything in between. If you’ve been looking to level up [&#8230;]</p>

### Title: Spectral Community Detection in Clinical Knowledge Graphs
Link: https://towardsdatascience.com/spectral-community-detection-in-clinical-knowledge-graphs/
Summary: <p>Introduction How do we identify latent groups of patients in a large cohort? How can we find similarities among patients that go beyond the well-known comorbidity clusters associated with specific diseases? And more importantly, how can we extract quantitative signals that can be analyzed, compared, and reused across different clinical scenarios? The information associated to [&#8230;]</p>
