### Title: Scaling RL to Long Videos
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07966
Summary: A framework for scaling vision-language models to long videos using reinforcement learning, achieving strong performance on various reasoning tasks with a specialized training infrastructure. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).

### Title: T-LoRA: Single Image Diffusion Model Customization Without Overfitting
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.05964
Summary: T-LoRA, a timestep-dependent low-rank adaptation framework, enhances diffusion model personalization with a dynamic fine-tuning strategy and orthogonal initialization, achieving better concept fidelity and text alignment in data-limited settings. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		While diffusion model fine-tuning offers a powerful approach for customizing pre-trained models to generate specific objects, it frequently suffers from overfitting when training samples are limited, compromising both generalization capability and output diversity. This paper tackles the challenging yet most impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image, as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones, necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model personalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept fidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in data-limited and resource-constrained scenarios.

### Title: Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning: Evaluation and
  Methodology
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07999
Summary: TreeBench evaluates visual grounded reasoning through subtle target detection, traceable evidence, and second-order reasoning, while TreeVGR enhances this with joint localization and reasoning using reinforcement learning. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control, TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60% accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR (Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning, enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

### Title: OST-Bench: Evaluating the Capabilities of MLLMs in Online
  Spatio-temporal Scene Understanding
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07984
Summary: OST-Bench evaluates multimodal large language models in online spatio-temporal reasoning tasks, revealing challenges in handling complex spatial cues and long-term memory in real-world scenarios. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and benchmark are available. Our project page is: https://rbler1234.github.io/OSTBench.github.io/

### Title: Multi-Granular Spatio-Temporal Token Merging for Training-Free
  Acceleration of Video LLMs
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07990
Summary: A spatio-temporal token merging method improves video LLM efficiency by exploiting redundancy, achieving significant speed-ups with minimal accuracy loss. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a 2times speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and a 3times speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

### Title: Geometry Forcing: Marrying Video Diffusion and 3D Representation for
  Consistent World Modeling
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07982
Summary: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However, our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment, which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page: https://GeometryForcing.github.io.

### Title: PyVision: Agentic Vision with Dynamic Tooling
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07998
Summary: PyVision, an interactive framework, enables LLMs to autonomously create and refine Python-based tools for visual reasoning, achieving significant performance improvements across benchmarks. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive, multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks. Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini. These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual reasoning.

### Title: LangSplatV2: High-dimensional 3D Language Gaussian Splatting with 450+
  FPS
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07136
Summary: LangSplatV2 enhances 3D text querying speed and accuracy by replacing the heavyweight decoder with a sparse coefficient field and efficient CUDA optimization. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		In this paper, we introduce LangSplatV2, which achieves high-dimensional feature splatting at 476.2 FPS and 3D open-vocabulary text querying at 384.6 FPS for high-resolution images, providing a 42 times speedup and a 47 times boost over LangSplat respectively, along with improved query accuracy. LangSplat employs Gaussian Splatting to embed 2D CLIP language features into 3D, significantly enhancing speed and learning a precise 3D language field with SAM semantics. Such advancements in 3D language fields are crucial for applications that require language interaction within complex scenes. However, LangSplat does not yet achieve real-time inference performance (8.2 FPS), even with advanced A100 GPUs, severely limiting its broader application. In this paper, we first conduct a detailed time analysis of LangSplat, identifying the heavyweight decoder as the primary speed bottleneck. Our solution, LangSplatV2 assumes that each Gaussian acts as a sparse code within a global dictionary, leading to the learning of a 3D sparse coefficient field that entirely eliminates the need for a heavyweight decoder. By leveraging this sparsity, we further propose an efficient sparse coefficient splatting method with CUDA optimization, rendering high-dimensional feature maps at high quality while incurring only the time cost of splatting an ultra-low-dimensional feature. Our experimental results demonstrate that LangSplatV2 not only achieves better or competitive query accuracy but is also significantly faster. Codes and demos are available at our project page: https://langsplat-v2.github.io.

### Title: A Survey on Long-Video Storytelling Generation: Architectures,
  Consistency, and Cinematic Quality
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07202
Summary: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16 seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16 seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their architectural designs and performance characteristics.

### Title: Skip a Layer or Loop it? Test-Time Depth Adaptation of Pretrained LLMs
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07996
Summary: A method using chain-of-layers (CoLa) derived from a pretrained large language model allows for dynamic architecture adaptation, improving efficiency and accuracy across diverse tasks through selective layer manipulation and Monte Carlo Tree Search optimization. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa, suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.

### Title: Token Bottleneck: One Token to Remember Dynamics
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.06543
Summary: ToBo is a self-supervised learning method that creates compact, temporally aware visual representations for sequential scene understanding tasks, outperforming baselines in both simulated and real-world environments. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Deriving compact and temporally aware visual representations from dynamic scenes is essential for successful execution of sequential scene understanding tasks such as visual tracking and robotic manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Token Bottleneck (ToBo), a simple yet intuitive self-supervised learning pipeline that squeezes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts the subsequent scene using minimal patches as hints. The ToBo pipeline facilitates the learning of sequential scene representations by conservatively encoding the reference scene into a compact bottleneck token during the squeeze step. In the expansion step, we guide the model to capture temporal dynamics by predicting the target scene using the bottleneck token along with few target patches as hints. This design encourages the vision backbone to embed temporal dependencies, thereby enabling understanding of dynamic transitions across scenes. Extensive experiments in diverse sequential tasks, including video label propagation and robot manipulation in simulated environments demonstrate the superiority of ToBo over baselines. Moreover, deploying our pre-trained model on physical robots confirms its robustness and effectiveness in real-world environments. We further validate the scalability of ToBo across different model scales.

### Title: Dynamic Chunking for End-to-End Hierarchical Sequence Modeling
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07955
Summary: Hierarchical networks replace traditional tokenization pipelines by dynamically learning segmentation strategies, achieving better performance and scalability across various languages and modalities. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

### Title: Machine Bullshit: Characterizing the Emergent Disregard for Truth in
  Large Language Models
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07484
Summary: Machine bullshit, characterized by LLMs' indifference to truth, is quantified and analyzed through a new framework, revealing that RLHF and CoT prompting exacerbate certain bullshit forms. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit: empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms, particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

### Title: Beyond the Linear Separability Ceiling
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07574
Summary: The study identifies a linear reasoning bottleneck in Visual-Language Models and proposes the Linear Separability Ceiling as a metric to evaluate it, suggesting targeted alignment rather than improved representation learning as a solution. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks. This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control, we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs. However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

### Title: Re-Bottleneck: Latent Re-Structuring for Neural Audio Autoencoders
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07867
Summary: A Re-Bottleneck framework modifies pre-trained autoencoders to enforce specific latent structures, improving performance in diverse downstream applications. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Neural audio codecs and autoencoders have emerged as versatile models for audio compression, transmission, feature-extraction, and latent-space generation. However, a key limitation is that most are trained to maximize reconstruction fidelity, often neglecting the specific latent structure necessary for optimal performance in diverse downstream applications. We propose a simple, post-hoc framework to address this by modifying the bottleneck of a pre-trained autoencoder. Our method introduces a "Re-Bottleneck", an inner bottleneck trained exclusively through latent space losses to instill user-defined structure. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in three experiments. First, we enforce an ordering on latent channels without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Second, we align latents with semantic embeddings, analyzing the impact on downstream diffusion modeling. Third, we introduce equivariance, ensuring that a filtering operation on the input waveform directly corresponds to a specific transformation in the latent space. Ultimately, our Re-Bottleneck framework offers a flexible and efficient way to tailor representations of neural audio models, enabling them to seamlessly meet the varied demands of different applications with minimal additional training.

### Title: Growing Transformers: Modular Composition and Layer-wise Expansion on a
  Frozen Substrate
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07129
Summary: A novel approach to scaling large language models through modular composition and layer-wise growth using fixed embeddings enhances performance and flexibility. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and progressive layer-wise growth.   First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g., Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.   Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to facilitate further research.

### Title: SciMaster: Towards General-Purpose Scientific AI Agents, Part I.
  X-Master as Foundation: Can We Lead on Humanity's Last Exam?
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.05241
Summary: The rapid advancements of AI agents have ignited the long-held ambition of leveraging them to accelerate scientific discovery. Achieving this goal requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such, Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters, sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to exceed the 30% threshold. This work allows us to gain a deeper understanding of complex task-solving and accumulates valuable experience that can inform future advancements, guiding subsequent model training.

### Title: Emergent Semantics Beyond Token Embeddings: Transformer LMs with Frozen
  Visual Unicode Representations
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.04886
Summary: Transformer models equipped with fixed, visually derived embeddings outperform those with trainable embeddings on a reasoning benchmark, challenging the traditional role of embeddings in LLMs. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational "meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic, precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable, semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to "representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further research.
