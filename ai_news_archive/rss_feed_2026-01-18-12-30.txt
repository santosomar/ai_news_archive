Summary: <p>Imagine a flock of birds in flight. There&#8217;s no leader. No central command. Each bird aligns with its neighbors—matching direction, adjusting speed, maintaining coherence through purely local coordination. The result is global order emerging from local consistency. Now imagine one bird flying with the same conviction as the others. Its wingbeats are confident. Its speed [&#8230;]</p>
