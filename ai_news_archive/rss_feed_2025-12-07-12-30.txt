### Title: The Machine Learning “Advent Calendar” Day 6: Decision Tree Regressor
Link: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-machine-learning-advent-calendar-day-6-decision-tree-regressor/
Summary: <p>During the first days of this Machine Learning Advent Calendar, we explored models based on distances. Today, we switch to a completely different way of learning: Decision Trees.<br />
With a simple one-feature dataset, we can see how a tree chooses its first split. The idea is always the same: if humans can guess the split visually, then we can rebuild the logic step by step in Excel.<br />
By listing all possible split values and computing the MSE for each one, we identify the split that reduces the error the most. This gives us a clear intuition of how a Decision Tree grows, how it makes predictions, and why the first split is such a crucial step.</p>
