#### 1. **Security in AI Models**
   - **CachePrune: Neural-Based Attribution Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks**: This paper addresses the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) to indirect prompt injection attacks. It proposes CachePrune, a method that prunes task-triggering neurons from the KV cache of input prompts to prevent the model from interpreting prompts as instructions. The approach uses a neural attribution mechanism to identify these neurons, enhancing model robustness against adversarial inputs while maintaining response quality.
   
   - **Towards Backdoor Stealthiness in Model Parameter Space**: This work investigates the effectiveness of backdoor attacks in AI models, particularly focusing on the parameter space. It reveals that existing backdoor attacks can be mitigated by examining the models in parameter space, leading to the development of Grond, a new backdoor attack that limits parameter changes during backdoor injection, achieving better stealthiness against defenses.

   - **Defense That Attacks: How Robust Models Become Better Attackers**: This paper explores the paradox of adversarially trained models producing more transferable adversarial examples. It emphasizes the need for robust evaluation methods that consider both the resistance of models to attacks and their ability to generate transferable adversarial examples.
