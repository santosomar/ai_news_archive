### Title: From Transactions to Trends: Predict When a Customer Is About to Stop Buying
Link: https://towardsdatascience.com/from-transactions-to-trends-predict-when-a-customer-is-about-to-stop-buying/
Summary: <p>Customer churn is usually a gradual process, not a sudden event. In this post, we analyze monthly transaction trends and convert regression slopes into degrees to clearly identify declining purchase behavior. A small negative slope today can prevent a big revenue loss tomorrow.</p>
