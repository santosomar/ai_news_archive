### Title: The Machine Learning “Advent Calendar” Bonus 2: Gradient Descent Variants in Excel
Link: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-machine-learning-advent-calendar-bonus-2-gradient-descent-variants-in-excel/
Summary: <p>Gradient Descent, Momentum, RMSProp, and Adam all aim for the same minimum. They do not change the destination, only the path. Each method adds a mechanism that fixes a limitation of the previous one, making the movement faster, more stable, or more adaptive. The goal stays the same. The update becomes smarter.</p>
