### Summary of Papers and News Related to Using AI for Security or Securing AI

#### Key Themes and Trends:
1. **Security Vulnerabilities in AI Systems**:
   - Several papers focus on the vulnerabilities of AI systems, particularly in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their deployment in sensitive applications. For instance, the paper "Agent Skills in the Wild: An Empirical Study of Security Vulnerabilities at Scale" highlights the risks associated with modular AI skills that execute with implicit trust, revealing that a significant percentage of skills contain vulnerabilities, including prompt injection and data exfiltration.

2. **Robustness and Safety Mechanisms**:
   - The importance of safety mechanisms in AI systems is emphasized across multiple studies. For example, "ToolSafe: Enhancing Tool Invocation Safety of LLM-based agents via Proactive Step-level Guardrail and Feedback" discusses proactive measures to detect unsafe tool invocation actions before execution, showcasing a shift towards more robust safety measures in AI applications.

3. **Evaluation Frameworks for AI Safety**:
   - The development of frameworks for evaluating the safety and reliability of AI systems is a recurring theme. "Scalable and Reliable Evaluation of AI Knowledge Retrieval Systems: RIKER and the Coherent Simulated Universe" introduces a benchmark for evaluating knowledge systems without human annotation, emphasizing the need for robust evaluation methods that can withstand contamination.
