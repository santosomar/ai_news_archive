  Mathematical Reasoning
Link: https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2508.10433
Summary: We-Math 2.0 enhances MLLMs' mathematical reasoning through a structured knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and reinforcement learning, demonstrating competitive performance on benchmarks. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper, we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math 2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising generalization in mathematical reasoning.

  Tokens at Scale
Link: https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2508.10711
Summary: NextStep-1, a 14B autoregressive model with a 157M flow matching head, achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation and image editing by processing discrete text tokens and continuous image tokens. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Prevailing autoregressive (AR) models for text-to-image generation either rely on heavy, computationally-intensive diffusion models to process continuous image tokens, or employ vector quantization (VQ) to obtain discrete tokens with quantization loss. In this paper, we push the autoregressive paradigm forward with NextStep-1, a 14B autoregressive model paired with a 157M flow matching head, training on discrete text tokens and continuous image tokens with next-token prediction objectives. NextStep-1 achieves state-of-the-art performance for autoregressive models in text-to-image generation tasks, exhibiting strong capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. Furthermore, our method shows strong performance in image editing, highlighting the power and versatility of our unified approach. To facilitate open research, we will release our code and models to the community.

### Title: ToonComposer: Streamlining Cartoon Production with Generative
  Post-Keyframing
Link: https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2508.10881
Summary: ToonComposer is a generative model that unifies inbetweening and colorization in cartoon production, using sparse sketches and a cartoon adaptation method to improve visual quality and efficiency. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening, and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage. ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios. To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality, motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

### Title: PRELUDE: A Benchmark Designed to Require Global Comprehension and
  Reasoning over Long Contexts
Link: https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2508.09848
Summary: A benchmark called PRELUDE evaluates long-context understanding by assessing the consistency of prequel stories with original books, revealing significant challenges for models compared to humans. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		We introduce PRELUDE, a benchmark for evaluating long-context understanding through the task of determining whether a character's prequel story is consistent with the canonical narrative of the original book. Our task poses a stronger demand for global comprehension and deep reasoning than existing benchmarks -- as the prequels are not part of the original story, assessing their plausibility typically requires searching and integrating information that is only indirectly related. Empirically, 88% of instances require evidence from multiple parts of the narrative. Experimental results highlight the challenge of our task: in-context learning, RAG and in-domain training with state-of-the-art LLMs, and commercial DeepResearch services, lag behind humans by >15%. A further human study reveals that models often produce correct answers with flawed reasoning, leading to an over 30% gap in reasoning accuracy compared to humans. These findings underscore the substantial room for improvement in long-context understanding and reasoning.

### Title: STream3R: Scalable Sequential 3D Reconstruction with Causal Transformer
Link: https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2508.10893
Summary: STream3R reformulates 3D reconstruction as a decoder-only Transformer problem, using causal attention to efficiently process image sequences and outperform existing methods in both static and dynamic scenes. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks. Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D understanding in streaming environments.

### Title: Puppeteer: Rig and Animate Your 3D Models
Link: https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2508.10898
Summary: Puppeteer is a framework that automates rigging and animation of 3D models using an auto-regressive transformer, attention-based architecture, and differentiable optimization, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally, we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in existing methods.

### Title: UI-Venus Technical Report: Building High-performance UI Agents with RFT
Link: https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2508.10833
Summary: UI-Venus, a multimodal large language model-based UI agent, achieves state-of-the-art performance in UI grounding and navigation tasks using reinforcement fine-tuning and novel self-evolving frameworks. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand high-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on Qwen2.5-VL. Specifically, the 7B and 72B variants of UI-Venus obtain 94.1% / 50.8% and 95.3% / 61.9% on the standard grounding benchmarks, i.e., Screenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including open-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5.To show UI-Venus's summary and planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9% success rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks and corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost navigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment \& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more coherent planning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our contributions include the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive data cleaning protocols and a novel self-evolving framework for improving navigation performance, which encourage further research and development in the community.

### Title: A Survey on Diffusion Language Models
Link: https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2508.10875
Summary: Diffusion Language Models offer parallel token generation, reducing inference latency and capturing bidirectional context, and are compared to autoregressive models in various NLP tasks. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods. Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism, caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field.

### Title: Pass@k Training for Adaptively Balancing Exploration and Exploitation of
  Large Reasoning Models
Link: https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2508.10751
Summary: Using Pass@k as a reward in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards improves exploration and reveals that exploration and exploitation can mutually enhance each other. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial. Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model (i.e., Pass@k Training), and observe the improvement on its exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover, Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a potential future direction.

### Title: HumanSense: From Multimodal Perception to Empathetic Context-Aware
  Responses through Reasoning MLLMs
Link: https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2508.10576
Summary: HumanSense is a benchmark for evaluating human-centered perception and interaction in Multimodal Large Language Models, focusing on multimodal context understanding and rational feedback through reinforcement learning. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks. Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks. Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage, modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results. Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner. Project page: brightpinkhttps://digital-avatar.github.io/ai/HumanSense/

### Title: Processing and acquisition traces in visual encoders: What does CLIP
  know about your camera?
Link: https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2508.10637
Summary: Visual encoders encode subtle image acquisition parameters that can significantly impact semantic predictions based on their correlation with semantic labels. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively, distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.   We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these acquisition-based or processing-based labels.

### Title: From Black Box to Transparency: Enhancing Automated Interpreting
  Assessment with Explainable AI in College Classrooms
Link: https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2508.10860
Summary: A multi-dimensional modeling framework enhances automated interpreting quality assessment by integrating feature engineering, data augmentation, and explainable machine learning, focusing on transparency and detailed diagnostic feedback. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Recent advancements in machine learning have spurred growing interests in automated interpreting quality assessment. Nevertheless, existing research suffers from insufficient examination of language use quality, unsatisfactory modeling effectiveness due to data scarcity and imbalance, and a lack of efforts to explain model predictions. To address these gaps, we propose a multi-dimensional modeling framework that integrates feature engineering, data augmentation, and explainable machine learning. This approach prioritizes explainability over ``black box'' predictions by utilizing only construct-relevant, transparent features and conducting Shapley Value (SHAP) analysis. Our results demonstrate strong predictive performance on a novel English-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and CometKiwi scores to be the strongest predictive features for fidelity, pause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological diversity metrics for language use. Overall, by placing particular emphasis on explainability, we present a scalable, reliable, and transparent alternative to traditional human evaluation, facilitating the provision of detailed diagnostic feedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning advantages not afforded by automated scores in isolation.

### Title: When Explainability Meets Privacy: An Investigation at the Intersection
  of Post-hoc Explainability and Differential Privacy in the Context of Natural
  Language Processing
Link: https://tldr.takara.ai/p/2508.10482
Summary: The study investigates the relationship between privacy and explainability in NLP, using Differential Privacy and Post-hoc Explainability methods, and provides recommendations for balancing both. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), a number of important research fields have emerged, including that of explainability and privacy. While research interest in both explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent years, there remains a lack of investigation at the intersection of the two. This leaves a considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving both explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the popular overarching methods of Differential Privacy (DP) and Post-hoc Explainability. Our findings include a view into the intricate relationship between privacy and explainability, which is formed by a number of factors, including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in a collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important intersection.
