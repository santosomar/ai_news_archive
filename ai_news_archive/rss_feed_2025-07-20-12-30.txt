### Title: A Survey of Context Engineering for Large Language Models
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.13334
Summary: Context Engineering systematically optimizes information payloads for Large Language Models, addressing gaps in generating sophisticated, long-form outputs. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components: context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs. Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately, this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers advancing context-aware AI.

### Title: VisionThink: Smart and Efficient Vision Language Model via Reinforcement
  Learning
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.13348
Summary: VisionThink dynamically adjusts image resolution and visual token processing for efficient and effective vision-language tasks, improving performance on OCR tasks while reducing token usage in simpler tasks. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4 resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression, namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionThink.

### Title: Ï€^3: Scalable Permutation-Equivariant Visual Geometry Learning
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.13347
Summary: A permutation-equivariant neural network, $\pi^3$, reconstructs visual geometry without a fixed reference view, achieving state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation, depth estimation, and point map reconstruction. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		We introduce pi^3, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, pi^3 employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.

### Title: The Imitation Game: Turing Machine Imitator is Length Generalizable
  Reasoner
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.13332
Summary: TAIL, a method that imitates Turing Machine execution processes, enhances the length generalization and performance of LLMs by synthesizing chain-of-thought data and reducing shortcut learning. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and 18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1. The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine, instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers. This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

### Title: AnyCap Project: A Unified Framework, Dataset, and Benchmark for
  Controllable Omni-modal Captioning
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.12841
Summary: The AnyCap Project introduces a framework, dataset, and evaluation protocol to enhance controllability and reliability in multimodal captioning. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities, 28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on widely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.

### Title: Diffuman4D: 4D Consistent Human View Synthesis from Sparse-View Videos
  with Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Models
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.13344
Summary: A sliding iterative denoising process is proposed to enhance spatio-temporal consistency in 4D diffusion models for high-fidelity view synthesis from sparse-view videos. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

### Title: RiemannLoRA: A Unified Riemannian Framework for Ambiguity-Free LoRA
  Optimization
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.12142
Summary: RiemannLoRA addresses initialization and overparametrization in LoRA by treating LoRA matrices as a smooth manifold, improving convergence speed and performance in LLMs and diffusion models. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted standard for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory and computational demands. However, challenges remain, including finding optimal initialization strategies or mitigating overparametrization in low-rank matrix factorization. In this work, we propose a novel approach that addresses both of the challenges simultaneously within a unified framework. Our method treats a set of fixed-rank LoRA matrices as a smooth manifold. Considering adapters as elements on this manifold removes overparametrization, while determining the direction of the fastest loss decrease along the manifold provides initialization. Special care is taken to obtain numerically stable and computationally efficient implementation of our method, using best practices from numerical linear algebra and Riemannian optimization. Experimental results on LLM and diffusion model architectures demonstrate that RiemannLoRA consistently improves both convergence speed and final performance over standard LoRA and its state-of-the-art modifications.

### Title: MindJourney: Test-Time Scaling with World Models for Spatial Reasoning
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.12508
Summary: MindJourney enhances vision-language models with 3D reasoning by coupling them with a video diffusion-based world model, achieving improved performance on spatial reasoning tasks without fine-tuning. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However, state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion: they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average 8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT, showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world models for test-time scaling.

### Title: Voxtral
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.13264
Summary: Voxtral Mini and Voxtral Small are multimodal audio chat models that excel in understanding spoken audio and text, with a 32K context window for handling long audio files and conversations. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		We present Voxtral Mini and Voxtral Small, two multimodal audio chat models. Voxtral is trained to comprehend both spoken audio and text documents, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of audio benchmarks, while preserving strong text capabilities. Voxtral Small outperforms a number of closed-source models, while being small enough to run locally. A 32K context window enables the model to handle audio files up to 40 minutes in duration and long multi-turn conversations. We also contribute three benchmarks for evaluating speech understanding models on knowledge and trivia. Both Voxtral models are released under Apache 2.0 license.

### Title: FantasyPortrait: Enhancing Multi-Character Portrait Animation with
  Expression-Augmented Diffusion Transformers
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.12956
Summary: FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer framework, generates high-fidelity and emotion-rich facial animations for single and multi-character scenarios using implicit representations and a masked cross-attention mechanism. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts.

### Title: AbGen: Evaluating Large Language Models in Ablation Study Design and
  Evaluation for Scientific Research
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.13300
Summary: AbGen evaluates LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research, revealing performance gaps compared to human experts and highlighting the unreliability of current automated evaluation methods. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs. Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation systems for complex scientific tasks.

### Title: Teach Old SAEs New Domain Tricks with Boosting
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.12990
Summary: A residual learning approach enhances Sparse Autoencoders to capture domain-specific features without retraining, improving interpretability and performance on specialized domains. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability of LLMs.

### Title: FLEXITOKENS: Flexible Tokenization for Evolving Language Models
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.12720
Summary: FLEXITOKENS, a byte-level language model with a learnable tokenizer, reduces token over-fragmentation and improves performance across multilingual and morphologically diverse tasks. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers, which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive. Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\% improvements on downstream task performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers. Code and data for our experiments will be released at https://github.com/owos/flexitokens

### Title: TLB-VFI: Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame
  Interpolation
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.04984
Summary: Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation (TLB-VFI) improves video frame interpolation by efficiently extracting temporal information, reducing parameters, and requiring less training data compared to existing methods. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to predict the intermediate frame I_n (we use n to denote time in videos to avoid notation overload with the timestep t in diffusion models) based on two consecutive neighboring frames I_0 and I_1. Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and video-based) in this task and achieve strong performance. However, image-based diffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively inefficient compared to non-diffusion methods. Video-based diffusion models can extract temporal information, but they are too large in terms of training scale, model size, and inference time. To mitigate the above issues, we propose Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation (TLB-VFI), an efficient video-based diffusion model. By extracting rich temporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating and temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on the most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models. Meanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method achieves strong performance while having 3times fewer parameters. Such a parameter reduction results in 2.3x speed up. By incorporating optical flow guidance, our method requires 9000x less training data and achieves over 20x fewer parameters than video-based diffusion models. Codes and results are available at our project page: https://zonglinl.github.io/tlbvfi_page.

### Title: Einstein Fields: A Neural Perspective To Computational General
  Relativity
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.11589
Summary: Einstein Fields, a neural tensor field representation, compresses four-dimensional numerical relativity simulations into neural network weights, enabling automatic differentiation and natural emergence of dynamics. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		We introduce Einstein Fields, a neural representation that is designed to compress computationally intensive four-dimensional numerical relativity simulations into compact implicit neural network weights. By modeling the metric, which is the core tensor field of general relativity, Einstein Fields enable the derivation of physical quantities via automatic differentiation. However, unlike conventional neural fields (e.g., signed distance, occupancy, or radiance fields), Einstein Fields are Neural Tensor Fields with the key difference that when encoding the spacetime geometry of general relativity into neural field representations, dynamics emerge naturally as a byproduct. Einstein Fields show remarkable potential, including continuum modeling of 4D spacetime, mesh-agnosticity, storage efficiency, derivative accuracy, and ease of use. We address these challenges across several canonical test beds of general relativity and release an open source JAX-based library, paving the way for more scalable and expressive approaches to numerical relativity.

### Title: Automating Steering for Safe Multimodal Large Language Models
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.13255
Summary: AutoSteer, a modular inference-time intervention technology, enhances the safety of Multimodal Large Language Models by reducing attack success rates across various threats without fine-tuning. 				 					AI-generated summary 				 		Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns, particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical, interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.
